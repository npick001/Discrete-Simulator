# Discrete-Simulator
This is the repo containing the source code for my personal discrete simulator.
Kai is helping out tremendously with the GUI frontend.

The software utilizes the MVC software architecture to handle the simulation and graphical interactions.

The goal of this project is to apply the knowledge gained in my undergrad to create a software that can handle the basic discrete event simulations.
This software will be a graphical editor where the simulation developer can drag simulation blocks from the toolbar into the canvas and apply event triggers to create simulation models for systems that can be described using discrete event methodology.

The software will incorporate knowledge from the following courses at ODU if you are interested in learning this information as well:
  - Simulation Software Design
  - Analysis for M&S
  - Discrete Event Simulation
