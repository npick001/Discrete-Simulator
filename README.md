# Discrete-Simulator
This is the repo containing the source code for my personal discrete simulator.

The software utilizes the MVC software architecture to handle the simulation and graphical interactions.

The goal of this project is to apply the knowledge gained in my undergrad to create a software environment that can handle basic discrete event simulations.
This application will be a graphical editor where the developer can drag simulation blocks from the toolbar into the canvas to create a simulation model.
Eventually there will be simulation experimentation and visualization.

The application incorporates knowledge from the following courses at ODU if you are interested in learning this information as well:
  - Simulation Software Design
  - Computer Graphics and Visualization
  - Analysis for M&S
  - Discrete Event Simulation
